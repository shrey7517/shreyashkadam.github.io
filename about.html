      <h1>About <span>Me</span></h1>

      <p>
        I am an Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering student with a strong
        interest in designing intelligent systems that combine hardware,
        simulation, and software. I enjoy understanding how systems work at a
        fundamental level and then translating that understanding into practical,
        working solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        My academic journey has given me hands-on exposure to embedded systems,
        Arduino-based prototyping, MATLAB and Simulink simulations, and early-stage
        machine learning applications. I believe simulation is a powerful tool to
        predict and improve real-world behavior before physical implementation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beyond technical skills, I value discipline, clarity, and calm decision-
        making under pressure. My involvement in innovation cells, national-level
        competitions, and leadership roles has helped me develop strong
        communication and teamwork abilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        I aim to grow as a systems-oriented engineer who can bridge theory and
        implementation, contributing to impactful engineering solutions in areas
        such as embedded intelligence, control systems, and communication
        technologies.
